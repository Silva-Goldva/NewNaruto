<h1>Sasuke Uchiha</h1>
<p>Sasuke Uchiha (うちはサスケ, Uchiha Sasuke) is one of the last surviving members of Konohagakure's Uchiha clan.
 After his older brother, Itachi, slaughtered their clan, Sasuke made it his mission in life to avenge 
 them by killing Itachi. He is added to Team 7 upon becoming a ninja and, through competition with his 
 rival and best friend, Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke starts developing his skills. Dissatisfied with his progress,
 he defects from Konoha so that he can acquire the strength needed to exact his revenge. His years of 
 seeking vengeance and his actions that followed become increasingly demanding, irrational and isolates 
 him from others, leading him to be branded as an international criminal. After learning the truth of his 
 brother's sacrifice, later proving instrumental in ending the Fourth Shinobi World War, and being happily 
 redeemed by Naruto, Sasuke decides to return to Konoha and dedicate his life to help protect the village 
 and its inhabitants, becoming referred to as the "Supporting Kage" (支う影, Sasaukage, Literally meaning: 
 Supporting Shadow).</p>

<h1>Background</h1>
<p>Sasuke is the second and youngest son of Mikoto and Fugaku Uchiha; they named him after Sasuke Sarutobi
 in the hopes that he would someday be just as strong of a shinobi.[9] Sasuke grew up in the shadow of 
 his older brother, Itachi, a natural prodigy who many in the Uchiha clan and the village would constantly
 compare Sasuke and any of his accomplishments to. Sasuke himself adored Itachi, never passing up an 
 opportunity to spend time with him. Although Itachi welcomed his company, letting Sasuke watch him 
 train and taking him on adventures into the forests,[10] Itachi in return rarely helped Sasuke himself 
 become a better shinobi; when asked, he would often instead poke Sasuke's forehead and promise to do 
 so some other time. Sasuke found this annoying, but didn't allow it to blemish his high opinion of his 
 brother.</p>

 <h1>Personality</h1>
<p>Sasuke was a happy child, eager to please and be worthy of his family name.[14] This changed after his 
entire family was killed by his older brother, Itachi, the person he most admired in the world. He 
became cold toward others, unmoved by and uninterested in what they do or think of him, choosing 
instead to keep to himself. He stopped using honourifics like "sensei" or "sama", something considered 
rude in the Japanese language. His only goal in life became to take revenge for his family's deaths and, 
by extension, acquire the power needed for that revenge, even if it meant acquiring an external power 
that wasn't his own.[15][16]</p>

<p>The pursuit of power, difficult enough on its own, is something that Sasuke repeatedly struggles with. 
Whenever he meets new people, he makes an evaluation of their abilities: those he perceives to be weaker 
than himself he arrogantly disregards, giving them as little attention as possible so that they won't 
hold him back; those he perceives as stronger he fixates over and tries to surpass, especially when he 
believes he should be their equal. As a member of Team 7 he is repeatedly exposed to Kakashi Hatake's 
philosophy that there is strength in teamwork. For a time, Sasuke accepts this, experiencing it 
first-hand on several of Team 7's missions. He even starts becoming attached to his teammates and starts 
to forget the vengeance he craved, achieving after so many years a measure of happiness. However, when 
he meets Itachi again in Part I and is summarily defeated, Sasuke decides the team is making him weak and 
chooses to leave them and Konoha entirely, focusing solely on himself.</p>
 
 <h1>Appearance</h1>
<p>Sasuke's typical clothing has changed a number of times throughout his life, but the Uchiha clan's 
crest is usually present somewhere on his clothing, such as the back of his shirt collar. For most of 
Part I, he wears a navy blue, short-sleeved shirt with a high collar, white shorts, and, for a time, 
white arm warmers. During the Chūnin Exams' finals, he wears a black, one-piece version of this usual 
attire with many small belts adorning his left arm and similar bands around both legs. He wears a 
blue-clothed forehead protector with both of these outfits, but starts wearing it less and less after 
being hospitalised by Itachi, finally abandoning it entirely at the end of Part I.</p>
 
 <h1>Abilities</h1>
<p>Like his older brother Itachi, Sasuke is recognised as a natural prodigy of the Uchiha clan, 
graduating at the top of his class in the Academy. He makes a strong impression on Kakashi Hatake 
in the bell test, and could fight on par with strong shinobi, such as Haku and Gaara in Part I. 
After being under Orochimaru's tutelage for two-and-a-half years, Sasuke becomes strong enough to 
fight and even pressure Akatsuki member Itachi, as well as the Fourth Raikage. With the Six Paths 
Chakra, he is compared to the Sage of Six Paths by Kurama, which is demonstrated when he helped 
overwhelm Madara as the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki. Madara himself stated he would have chosen Sasuke 
over Obito as an apprentice if he was born years earlier.[22] As an adult, despite losing his left 
arm, his performance has shown no signs of impediment, as he could fight on par with Kinshiki Ōtsutsuki. 
Ultimately, he is regarded as a legendary shinobi[23] that like Naruto, is referred to as the strongest 
shinobi,[24] with the pair's combined strength being thought to be able to destroy the continent.</p>
 
 <h1>Ninjutsu</h1>
<p>Sasuke learns to summon snakes during his time with Orochimaru. He typically summons them as shields, 
rapid ground transportation, or to bind targets. Unseen outside of the Animal Path, Sasuke can also 
summon a second animal species: hawks. His use of hawks is more limited than snakes, using them only 
for flight and the additional manoeuvrability that allows. By adulthood, Sasuke can use the Shadow 
Clone Technique, able to easily produce eight clones at once.</p>
