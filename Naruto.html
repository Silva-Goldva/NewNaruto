<h1>Naruto Uzumaki</h1>
<p>Naruto Uzumaki (うずまきナルト, Uzumaki Naruto) is a shinobi of Konohagakure's Uzumaki clan.
 He became the jinchūriki of the Nine-Tails on the day of his birth — a fate that caused him to be shunned
 by most of Konoha throughout his childhood. After joining Team Kakashi, Naruto worked hard to gain the
 village's acknowledgement all the while chasing his dream to become Hokage. In the following years,
 through many hardships and ordeals, he became a capable ninja regarded as a hero both by the villagers,
 and soon after, the rest of the world, becoming known as the Hero of the Hidden Leaf (木ノ葉隠れの英雄,
 Konohagakure no Eiyū, Literally meaning: Hero of the Hidden Tree Leaves). He soon proved to be one of the
 main factors in winning the Fourth Shinobi World War, leading him to achieve his dream and become the
 village's Seventh Hokage (七代目火影, Nanadaime Hokage, Literally meaning: Seventh Fire Shadow).</p>

<h1>Background</h1>
<p>Naruto was born on the night of October 10th to Minato Namikaze (the Fourth Hokage) and Kushina Uzumaki
 (the second jinchūriki of the Nine-Tails). He was named after Naruto Musasabi, the protagonist of Jiraiya's
 first book, which made the Sannin his godfather.[14] The Third Hokage made special arrangements for Minato
 to preserve Kushina's seal containing the Nine-Tails while she gave birth to Naruto in a remote location,
 escorted by midwives and Anbu. A masked man, Tobi, tracked down their location, however, killed the
 midwives and Anbu, and captured Naruto, forcing Minato to quickly rescue him and teleport him to a
 safe house.</p>
 
 <h1>Personality</h1>
<p>Growing up as an orphan who suffered years of hatred and social isolation by Konoha's villagers
 has influenced Naruto's character in a number of ways: he is heedless to formality and social standings,
 addressing certain people with nicknames instead of honourifics, although by the time of his adulthood,
 Naruto has slightly outgrown this trait, as he stopped referring to Lee as "Bushy Brows" and calls him
 by his name, while also referring to Killer B by his name instead of "Octopops";[30][31] he has picky
 eating habits of ramen, his favourite food; he has a perverted side that manifests as uses of the Sexy
 Technique or attempts to peep into women's baths;[32] he didn't understand the real meaning of "love"
 and believes that loving and/or being loved by someone and ramen are both the same. Despite his quirks
 and the criticism they earn him, Naruto is said to have a personality that draws people to him,[33]
 inspiring friendship and loyalty through acts of genuine kindness that could change a person's world
 view. He is thus able to build meaningful relationships that he lacked in early life; the Sage of Six
 Paths believes Naruto's kindness is a special gift that allows him to save Kurama from its hatred.[34]
 Naruto deeply cherishes these bonds and will go to great lengths to protect them, best seen with Sasuke
 after his defection from Konoha. Naruto's time at the Falls of Truth revealed that a part of him hated
 the villagers for ostracising him, only to admire him after he saved them during Pain's Assault. This
 hidden resentment allowed Kurama to manipulate Naruto's rage until he confronted it and learned to let
 it go, becoming greater than what he suffered.[35]</p>
 
 <h1>Appearance</h1>
<p>According to Jiraiya, Naruto strongly resembles his father:[47] he has yellow-blond, spiky hair 
 and blue eyes, while inheriting the shape of his mother's eyes and face.[48] His trademark 
 characteristic are the three whisker markings on his cheeks. During the Fourth Shinobi World War, 
 Dan Katō initially mistook Naruto for Nawaki due to their stark resemblance.[49] Naruto was rather 
 short for his age during Part I,[50] though he grew to be taller than Sakura in Part II.[51] Naruto 
 originally wore green goggles on his forehead, though he discards them upon becoming a genin.</p>
 
 <h1>Abilities</h1>
 <p>Originally, Naruto was a rather inept ninja, failing to graduate from the Academy three times.
 Through sheer determination, however, his skills rapidly improved to defeat strong shinobi like 
 Neji Hyūga, Gaara, and Kabuto Yakushi, earning acknowledgement from all the Sannin for his potential.[53]
 Under various tutelage, Naruto was able to defeat various members of Akatsuki, ultimately earning praise
 from Konohagakure as a Hokage-material hero.[54] Naruto's personally defeated various reincarnated Kage
 [55] and jinchūriki during the Fourth Shinobi World War.[56] He also could compete against if not defeat
 world-threatening opponents, such as Madara Uchiha, Kaguya and Toneri Ōtsutsuki. Many believe Naruto was
 the central key to winning the war.[57][58][59] By adulthood, his prowess made him the Seventh Hokage,
 regarded as the strongest shinobi in history[60] and having command of overwhelming jutsu.[61] With the
 combined might of Sasuke Uchiha, noted as the only shinobi to rival him,[39] they are said able to 
 destroy a continent.[62] Together, they overpowered transformed Momoshiki Ōtsutsuki, and pushed Isshiki
 Ōtsutsuki's vessel to its limit, with the latter admitting that his vessel was too weak to defeat Naruto
 without his assistance.</p>
 
 <h1>Ninjutsu</h1>
 <p>In the Academy, the Sexy Technique was the only technique that Naruto could perform successfully, 
 which had no practical use other than to shock people. Later, he learned more advanced and useful 
 ninjutsu from Jiraiya. This included summoning toads from Mount Myōboku to assist him, and use them 
 to crush enemies from above. He became skilled in shurikenjutsu, able to throw weapons quickly and with 
 precision.[94] Naruto's repertoire expanded to fūinjutsu, where he could storing his weapons within 
 scrolls. His fūinjutsu was further increaed upon receiving Gerotora near the start of the Fourth Shinobi 
 World War.[95] In the anime, Jiraiya taught Naruto cooperation ninjutsu, combining his techniques with 
 others to create an even more powerful one.[96] The collaboration techniques he performed with other 
 individuals typically utilised his own elemental affinity, such as the Typhoon Water Vortex Technique 
 with Yamato, the Wind Release: Toad Gun with Gamatatsu, and the Scorch Release: Halo Hurricane Jet Black 
 Arrow Style Zero with Sasuke. He also learned from Asuma Sarutobi to flow into his weapons to increase 
 their offensive might.</p>
