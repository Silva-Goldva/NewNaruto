<h1>Vegeta</h1>
<p>Vegeta (ベジータ Bejīta), more specifically Vegeta IV (ベジータ四世 Bejīta Yonsei)[5], recognized as Prince 
Vegeta (ベジータ王子 Bejīta Ōji) is the prince of the fallen Saiyan race and one of the major characters of 
the Dragon Ball series. He is the eldest son of Vegeta III, the older brother of Tarble, the husband of 
Bulma, the father of Trunks and Bulla, and the ancestor of Vegeta Jr. Alongside Goku, Gohan, Bulma, 
Krillin, and Piccolo, he is easily one of the most prominent characters in the series, receiving more 
character development after being introduced than a number of other characters.</p>

<p>Regal, egotistical, and full of pride, Vegeta was once a ruthless, cold-blooded warrior and outright 
killer,[6] but later abandons his role in the Frieza Force, instead opting to remain and live on Earth, 
fighting alongside the universe's most powerful warrior, specifically with the mission to defeat and 
surpass Goku in power.[7] His character evolves from villain, to anti-hero, to a hero through the course 
of the series.</p>

<h1>Background</h1>
<p>Vegeta and Bulma initially met on planet Namek, but neither actually talked to the other; Bulma was too 
frightened, and Vegeta did not care, especially when his main concern was to find the Dragon Balls. 
However, their first interaction with each other was prior to his rematch with Zarbon, to which Vegeta 
threatened to kill both Bulma and Krillin. The first time any affection is displayed between them is 
in "Immortality Denied", in which Vegeta, during a conversation with Gohan, refers to Bulma as a 
"Gorgeous Girl" in the Ocean Group dubs. The first hint of Bulma's attraction to Vegeta is right after 
Goku's battle with Frieza and Planet Namek's destruction, in which Bulma told Vegeta she thought he was 
cute and he should lighten up a bit, much to his bafflement.</p>

 <h1>Personality</h1>
<p>Vegeta is arrogant throughout the series, and becomes bitter due to the abuse his race suffered at the 
hands of Frieza. Following the destruction of his home world Planet Vegeta, his hatred toward Frieza 
grows. His royalty seems to have bestowed upon him an inflated sense of superiority, holding himself 
above nearly everyone he encounters. He is immensely proud of his Saiyan heritage and believes his race 
to be the most powerful in the universe. Despite this, even as an antagonist he did not act like an 
ordinary Saiyan, being even more cruel and prideful thanks to Frieza's influence. As the Prince of a 
demolished Planet Vegeta, Vegeta is initially introduced as an unrepentant villain. Judging from his 
evil intentions before joining the Z Fighters, Vegeta has been consistently characterized as extremely 
arrogant, vengeful, and at times, cold. Many of Vegeta's early heroic acts are because of self-interest 
or revenge, although he later settles down and grows fond of Earth as his home, raising a family with 
Bulma. Having been born into the upper tier of Saiyan society, Vegeta was fixated on achieving the 
legendary status of Super Saiyan and becoming the most powerful warrior in the universe. Vegeta is more 
of a tactical fighter who often rushes in the brawl without hesitation. However, his rage or arrogance 
often causes him to underestimate his opponent and usually leads to his eventual defeat and sometimes 
death. His royal blood and intense fighting style has both benefited and harmed him in many battles. 
Vegeta has been shown to be one of the more intelligent characters of the series, as well as one of the
most serious, rarely exhibiting humor. When he does so, his humor is often very dry and far darker than 
his fellow Z Fighters . However, he does delight in mocking his enemies, as demonstrated when he offers 
to reconstruct Android 18 into a "toaster" or a "washing machine" (Funimation dub only). He also shows 
his bleak sense of humor towards Goku when he was about to battle him in the World Martial Arts 
Tournament. Aside from his more bleak sense of humor, he has also at times engaged in more sarcastic 
humor when gloating. A notable example of this was when fighting Semi-Perfect Cell . When Cell 
demanded to know how Vegeta was as strong as he was, Vegeta flippantly stated that he got that strong by
 "doing lots of push ups and sit ups, and [drinking] plenty of juice", as well as calling Kid Buu a 
 "gifted speaker" when the latter barely responded at all just before the latter destroyed the Earth. 
 Normally, his massive ego and arrogance overshadow his positive qualities. Despite his personality 
 flaws Vegeta is capable of respecting individuals, although he never outright states it often showing 
 his respect non verbally. By The Majin Buu Saga it his heavily implied that he and Piccolo were on 
 civil terms and seemed to have mutual respect for one another. He also expressed some grief over 
 Gohan's fate at the hands of Buu himself. Outside of these two instances, his relationship with the 
 rest of the Dragon Team seemed cool at best.</p>
 
 <h1>Appearance</h1>
<p>Vegeta is a slim yet well-built man of a below-average stature. His hair is black (or dark brown, 
depending on the media) spiky and it firmly stands upwards and has a prominent widow's peak. 
Like most Saiyans, he possesses defined eyes with a near-consistently stern look to them and 
his hair is a shade of black. Like other Universe 7 Saiyans, he was born with a prehensile brown-
furred tail, until it was permanently (despite him stating it would grow back eventually) cut off 
by Yajirobe.</p>

<p>Over the course of the series, Vegeta's physical appearance changes. While originally appearing 
very short and lean, especially compared to his massive partner, Nappa, he later seems to be somewhat 
taller and noticeably more muscular. His hair and forehead appears to be shorter and his facial 
features, which are perpetually in a scowl, also look more distinct and sharply defined as the series 
progresses, making him look much older in later sagas compared to what he looked like in the Raditz Saga.</p>
 
 <h1>Abilities</h1>
<p>Frieza keeps Vegeta, Nappa, and Raditz as combatants to do his bidding. In the manga chapter of the 
Namek Saga, Vegeta is angry over working under Frieza. Vegeta is especially reluctant to take orders 
from Frieza's right-hand man, Zarbon, whom Vegeta states is responsible for mocking him for many years 
and "working him like a slave." Despite being Frieza's underling, Vegeta constantly and proudly calls 
himself the "Prince of all Saiyans." Vegeta does not refer to himself as the "King of all Saiyans", 
possibly out of respect for his father, a refusal to admit the extinction of the Saiyans, or because he 
was never formally declared King. Vegeta planned to assassinate Frieza several times. However, after 
witnessing Frieza's incredible display of power when he destroyed an entire planet and the rebels who 
opposed Frieza on it with a single gigantic energy ball fired from his index finger, Vegeta decided 
that he would need to wait before challenging Frieza.[15] After an assignment to wipe out the planet 
Shikk alongside his comrades Raditz and Nappa, Vegeta restrained Nappa when the latter attempted to 
brashly attack Frieza, Zarbon, and Dodoria for mocking the manner in which they took out the planet as 
he realized that his group did not stand a chance against Frieza's Elite. Nonetheless, he was still 
visibly angry and had to restrain himself from attacking when Zarbon mocked him as he was leaving.</p>
 
 <h1>Ninjutsu</h1>
<p>Vegeta is born around Age 732. His father, King Vegeta, was the king of the Saiyan race. Vegeta and 
his race are also under the rule of the interplanetary warlord Frieza, and King Vegeta was also forced 
by Frieza to surrender him to the latter through undisclosed means. While under Frieza's grip, Vegeta 
was pressured by Frieza to do his bidding or else Frieza would murder Vegeta's father.</p>
