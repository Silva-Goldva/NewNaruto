<h1>Goku</h1>
<p>Son Goku (孫そん悟ご空くう Son Gokū), born Kakarot (カカロット Kakarotto), is the main protagonist of the 
Dragon Ball metaseries. Goku is a Saiyan originally sent to Earth as an infant. However, an accident 
alters his memory, allowing him to grow up to become Earth's greatest defender and the informal leader 
of the Dragon Team. He constantly strives and trains to be the greatest warrior possible, which has kept 
the Earth and the universe safe from destruction many times.</p>

<h1>Background</h1>
<p>Goku was named Kakarot at birth. In the manga, Kakarot was born on Planet Vegeta three years before 
its destruction, while in the anime Goku was born shortly before the destruction of the planet. When 
Frieza destroyed Planet Vegeta, Goku survived as he was being sent to Earth.</p>

<p>After landing on Earth, the young Saiyan was found in the woods by an old man named Gohan and became 
his adopted grandson. Grandpa Gohan names him "Son Goku".</p>

 <h1>Personality</h1>
<p>Originally as an infant Saiyan, Goku was very timid, constantly crying for attention. Goku was then 
programmed with intense hostility to carry out his mission of eradicating all sentient life on Earth. 
When found by Grandpa Gohan, he was unruly and aggressive, wanting nothing to do with the elder, 
although this was seemingly only when worked up as when initially found by Gohan, he quickly took a 
liking to the old man. However, after the head injury that caused him to lose his instinctual 
aggression, Goku became well-known for his energetic and caring personality traits he inherited from 
his mother Gine. He was taught to be respectful to others by Grandpa Gohan. He takes most situations 
in stride, he rarely lets things get him worked up; he quickly got over losing his tail each time. He 
is however not without fear. Goku is shown to be submissive to overbearing women like Bulma and Chi-Chi, 
even to the point of Master Roshi jokingly declaring that for all his universal-class might, he is 
terrified of his wife. In the anime, he also has aichmophobia; a crippling fear of needles. He is not 
beyond feeling sorrow, most noticeably seen from the loss of his grandfather. He is not above feeling 
shame, as he regrets to his lack of maturity as a person despite all the teachers who have helped him 
and likewise wants to make his loved-ones proud of him. He also shows genuine concern for the well-being
 of those close to him. When Master Roshi seemingly died against Ganos, Goku frantically rushed to his 
 aid, desperate to save his mentor and shed tears of joy when he managed to revive him.</p>
 
<p>He is well-noted for his love of any food, even by Saiyan standards,[3] which can be comical at times. 
When hypnotized while facing "Jackie Chun", Bulma told Goku dinner was ready, instantly waking him up.
[17] Like most Saiyans, Goku loves combat and to challenge strong opponents. As such Goku rarely shows 
nervousness or fear when fighting. While not arrogant in his abilities (especially compared to Vegeta),
 Goku has a tendency to be too relaxed and recklessly challenge anyone he views as strong to a fight. 
 Despite his fighting spirit, he is at heart a pacifist as he often spares his enemies, trying to avoid 
 hurting or even killing people if possible and never using more strength than necessary.[18][19] He 
 also strongly believes that people can change for the better, as he spared Vegeta after killing most of
 Goku's allies. This combined with his naturally gentle nature can lead to him letting his guard down.</p>

<p>Goku is pure of heart, possessing no negative feelings or thoughts. He is highly loyal to his friends 
and family, even willing to sacrifice himself to save others as he did against Raditz and Cell. He 
strongly believes in repaying debts, as he gave the then-evil Vegeta a senzu bean for technically 
saving Gohan and Krillin from the Ginyu Force. He is a man of his word, committed to keeping his 
promise no matter what; a prime example being giving the Omni-King a friend even more fun than himself. 
He has a very practical and carefree view of life and his goals are very simple; he only seeks new 
adventures and challenges like testing his limits as a warrior. He has no interest in luxury or high-
ranking positions as he rejected Kami's offer to become Guardian of Earth and likewise Whis' offer to 
become the next Universe 7 God of Destruction, though the latter was mainly due to his morality making 
him unsuitable for it. At the same time, he shows such unwavering will and tenacity to succeed, always 
determined to never give up against any adversity.</p>
 
 <h1>Appearance</h1>
<p>Essentially, Goku is the spitting-image of his father, Bardock, possessing the same spiky black hairstyle, 
dark-colored eyes, and facial features. However, he has softer eyes, a kind demeanor, and a lighter-pale 
skin complexion from his mother, Gine. Goku's most distinguishing physical characteristic is his hair. He 
has 3 bangs hanging to the right of his forehead and 2 bangs hanging to the left. His hair also stands up 
in the front with 4 spikes and 3 bangs in the back (later in the anime his front spikes become 5 and his 
back spikes become 4). Goku was born with the signature tail of the Universe 7 Saiyans, which was long 
and prehensile with brown fur. While occasionally having it removed and later regrew it, by his late 
teens, it was permanently removed by Kami (to prevent his Great Ape transformation so Kami could safely 
bring back the moon).</p>

<p>At age 12, Goku was rather short and appeared even younger than he was, being considered less than 10 
years old (people were surprised when learning his actual age). During the next few years, Goku did not 
go through any physical changes, beyond his muscles becoming more pronounced. By age 15, he began showing 
noticeable increases in height. By age 18, he had a considerable growth spurt, growing taller than most 
of his friends and developing a well-built physique. He is also considered very handsome, as noted by 
various women including Bulma and Heles. His physical changes made him almost indistinguishable from 
before and was only recognized by his signature naïve personality and "trademark" hairstyle. By age 25, 
Goku had another growth spurt, and become similar in height to his taller human allies, and much more 
muscular.</p>
 
 <h1>Abilities</h1>
<p>Two days later, the gang ends up at Fire Mountain, where Goku ends up fighting the Ox-King after he 
attempts to kill Bulma and Oolong.[30] After Goku summons the Flying Nimbus, the Ox-King stops fighting
 and tells Goku that the man who gave Goku that cloud is the same master that taught him. In an effort 
 to douse the fire surrounding the Ox-King's castle at the top of the mountain, Goku is sent to retrieve
 the Bansho Fan from Master Roshi after picking up the Ox-King's daughter, Chi-Chi. When they arrive at 
 Master Roshi's Island, he tells them that he accidentally threw the fan out and decides to come there 
 himself and put out the flames. When they get back to Fire Mountain, Master Roshi uses a technique 
 called the Kamehameha to put out the flames, unfortunately destroying the mountain as well.[31] Much 
 to Master Roshi's surprise, Goku immediately imitates the wave and makes one big enough to destroy 
 their car. While Bulma and Oolong find the Dragon Ball in the rubble, Master Roshi asks that Goku 
 trains with him after finishing his quest for the Dragon Balls.</p>
 
 <h1>Ninjutsu</h1>
<p>After Goku's victory against the Red Ribbon Army, he is still missing one more Dragon Ball to 
revive Bora, but for some reason, Bulma's Dragon Radar cannot locate it. Roshi tells Goku about his 
older sister Baba who can find anything.[67] Goku sets out to Fortuneteller Baba's Palace with Yamcha, 
Krillin, Upa and Puar. Baba turns out to not be so generous, forcing them to fight her five strongest 
warriors to get their request.[68] The first two warriors are taken care of by Goku's friends, but 
Yamcha is defeated by the third warrior, Bandages the Mummy.[69] Goku, the team's last fighter, takes 
him out along with the fourth fighter, Spike the Devil Man in Devil's Toilet.[70] After that, Goku is 
put up against the fifth fighter, who seems very familiar to Goku and Roshi (who had joined the group 
as a spectator). The mysterious fighter ruthlessly whips Goku around by his tail until it simply rips 
off. Goku then wins the fight, and the fifth fighter is revealed to be his Grandpa Gohan, who was 
brought back from the Other World for a day.[71] Baba reveals the Dragon Ball to be in a case Emperor 
Pilaf has. Goku confronts Pilaf in his new robot fused with Shu and Mai's robots and easily defeats 
them.[72] With all the Dragon Balls in his power, Goku calls Shenron and revives Bora. After the wish 
is granted, Goku grabs the four-star ball before the others scatter.</p>
