<h1>Madara Uchiha</h1>
<p>Madara Uchiha (うちはマダラ, Uchiha Madara) was the legendary leader of the Uchiha clan. 
He founded Konohagakure alongside his childhood friend and rival, Hashirama Senju, with the 
intention of beginning an era of peace. When the two couldn't agree on how to achieve that peace, 
they fought for control of the village, a conflict which ended in Madara's death. Madara, however, 
rewrote his death and went into hiding to work on his own plans. Unable to complete it in his natural 
life, he entrusted his knowledge and plans to Obito Uchiha shortly before his actual death. 
Years later, Madara would be revived, only to see his plans foiled and ultimately, and finally, 
realizing the error of his ways and making amends with Hashirama before his final death.</p>

<h1>Background</h1>
<p>Madara was born during the Warring States Period, and was the eldest of Tajima Uchiha's five sons.
[6] Madara and his brothers grew up on the battlefield waging constant war with the Uchiha's rivals:
 the Senju. Three of his brothers died young, leaving Madara with only his younger brother, Izuna. 
 Madara and Izuna became very close through their shared loss and constantly competed with each other
 to get stronger.[7] This, combined with his naturally strong chakra, enabled the young Madara to 
 defeat adult Senju in battle and develop a reputation as a genius.</p>

 <h1>Personality</h1>
<p>Madara's childhood was a product of the times he lived in: the constant fighting made him a 
perfectionist that would keep at something until he mastered it, and his triumphs on the 
battlefield made him very confident in his abilities and talent.[25] Whenever one of these 
personality traits was challenged, as they tended to be by Hashirama, Madara's competitive 
streak would emerge. Madara did not mind Hashirama's influence in this regard; he believed 
that the only way to survive in the shinobi world was to make allies with one's enemies.[26] 
His exposure to Hashirama is credited for Madara not experiencing the Uchiha's "Curse of Hatred" 
or at the very least, not being victimised by it as much as Izuna was and even though he claimed 
to have abandoned his friendship with Hashirama, Madara still held onto their friendship subconsciously.
[27] Madara's actions and beliefs were singularly focused on protecting Izuna, his only surviving 
brother.[28] So long as he had Izuna, Madara was reasonable and kind, willing to make concessions 
for a perceived greater good.</p>
 
 <h1>Appearance</h1>
<p>Madara was a fair-skinned man with spiky, black hair that had a slight blue tint to it. In his childhood,
 his hair was chin-length that parted to frame the sides of his face. His casual attire consisted of a 
 blue long sleeve shirt and white pants. While on the battlefield he wore the standard Uchiha outfit: a 
 black shirt with a high-collar left slightly open and the clan's crest on its back, with blue pants 
 and bandages around his shins. Around his waist he had a white sash that held a sack, presumably 
 containing his ninja tools.[7] Later, his sash was replaced by a belt, adorned with pouches and 
 various weapons. He also wore another sash strapped across his shoulders which he used to hold 
 his swords.</p>
 
 <h1>Abilities</h1>
<p>Madara was one of the most gifted shinobi in history, recognised as the strongest member of the Uchiha
 clan in his lifetime.[49][50] A child prodigy, he killed several adult Senju before he had awakened
 his Sharingan.[51] History remembers him best for competing with Hashirama Senju, a "God of Shinobi",
 and pushing him to his absolute limits.[52][53] When Obito began operating under Madara's name, 
 fear of Madara's power forced the Five Great Shinobi Countries, and the neutral Land of Iron, to band
 together and trigger the Fourth Shinobi World War, with Tsunade exclaiming that Madara's name itself
 was power.[54] After his return from death and acquisition of Wood Release, Madara was more than
 powerful enough to defeat the Five Kage at once, and later the nine tailed beasts after stealing
 Kurama's chakra from alliance Shinobi, along with Hashirama's senjutsu chakra and entering Sage Mode.</p>
 
 <h1>Ninjutsu</h1>
<p>Madara was well-versed in a variety of ninjutsu styles: he could use juinjutsu powerful enough to 
restrict the target's actions,[72] hide within surfaces to avoid damage and traverse the battlefield 
unnoticed,[73] and through an unorthodox use of the Shadow Clone Technique, fake his death by having 
a clone act as his corpse.[74] In the anime, Madara showed the ability to levitate.[75]</p>

<p>Madara was an adept sensor, being able to detect others' chakra signature countries away,[32] 
determine a person's clan and the nature of their kekkei genkai,[76] and even differentiate 
species.[77] When amplified by Sage Mode, he could even fight whilst blind by locating targets 
and dodging attacks through his sensory perception.</p>
