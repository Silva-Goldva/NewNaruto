<h2 id="one">Shonen Jump</h2>
<p>Weekly Shōnen Jump (Japanese: 週刊少年ジャンプ, Hepburn: Shūkan Shōnen Janpu, stylized in English as WEEKLY
 JUMP) is a weekly shōnen manga anthology published in Japan by Shueisha under the Jump line of magazines.
 It is the best-selling manga magazine,[5] as well as one of the longest-running; the first issue was 
 released with a cover date of August 1, 1968. The manga series within the magazine target young male 
 readers and tend to consist of a large number of action scenes and a fair amount of comedy. The chapters
 of series that run in Weekly Shōnen Jump are collected and published in tankōbon volumes under the 
 "Jump Comics" imprint every two to three months.</p>

<p>The mid-1980s to the mid-1990s represents the era when the magazine's circulation was at its highest,
 6.53 million copies per week. As of early 2017, it had a weekly circulation of 1.9 million copies.[6] 
 The magazine sold over 7.5 billion copies since 1968, making it the best-selling comic/manga magazine.
 [7] Many of the best-selling manga originate from Weekly Shōnen Jump.</p>

<p>Shōnen Jump spawned the Jump magazine line as well as the Jump Comics imprint label for publishing 
tankōbon. Weekly Shōnen Jump has two sister magazines called Jump SQ, created after the fall of Monthly
 Shōnen Jump, and Saikyō Jump. The magazine has also had several international counterparts, including
 the current North American Weekly Shonen Jump. It also spawned a crossover media franchise including 
 anime and video games (since Famicom Jump) which bring together various Shōnen Jump characters.</p>

<h2 id="two">History</h2>
<p>Weekly Shōnen Jump was launched by Shueisha on July 2, 1968, to compete with the already-successful 
Weekly Shōnen Magazine and Weekly Shōnen Sunday.[8] Weekly Shōnen Jump's sister publication was a 
manga magazine called Shōnen Book, which was originally a male version of the short-lived shōjo manga
 anthology Shōjo Book.[9] Prior to issue 20, Weekly Shōnen Jump was originally called simply Shōnen 
 Jump as it was originally a bi-weekly magazine. In 1969, Shōnen Book ceased publication[10] at which
 time Shōnen Jump became a weekly magazine[10] and a new monthly magazine called Bessatsu Shōnen Jump
 was made to take Shōnen Book's place. This magazine was later rebranded as Monthly Shōnen Jump before
 eventually being discontinued and replaced by Jump SQ.</p>

<p>Due to the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, the shipment of the 15th issue of 2011 was delayed 
in some areas of Japan. In response, Shueisha published the series included in that issue for free 
on its website from March 23 to April 27.[11]</p>

<p>On July 11, 2013, the Namco Bandai Group opened an amusement park themed around Weekly Shōnen Jump 
series. Titled J-World Tokyo, it is located on the third floor of the Sunshine City World Import Mart
 Building in Ikebukuro and is 1.52 acres.[12][13]</p>

<p>In celebration of the magazine's 45th anniversary in 2013, Shueisha began a contest where anyone can
 submit manga in three different languages, Japanese, English and Chinese. Judged by the magazine's 
 editorial department, four awards will be given, a grand prize and one for each language, each 
 including 500,000 yen (about US$4,900) and guaranteed publication in either Jump, its special editions,
 North American edition, China's OK! Comic, or Taiwan's Formosa Youth.[14]</p>

<p>A mobile phone app titled "Jump Live" was launched in August 2013, it features exclusive content 
from the artists whose series run in Weekly Shōnen Jump.[15]</p>

<p>Famicom Jump: Hero Retsuden, released in 1988 for the Family Computer was produced to commemorate
 the magazine's 20th anniversary. It was followed by a sequel: Famicom Jump II: Saikyō no Shichinin
 in 1991, also for the Family Computer. In 2000, two more games were created for the purpose of 
 commemorating the magazine's anniversaries. A crossover fighting game titled Jump Super Stars was
 released for the Nintendo DS in 2005. It was followed by Jump Ultimate Stars in 2006. A new crossover
 game, J-Stars Victory Vs., was released in 2014 for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita to 
 commemorate Jump's 45 anniversary.</p>

<p>In June 2018, a limited 50th Anniversary Shōnen Jump Edition of the Famicom Mini (NES Classic Edition) 
game console was released in Japan. It sold 110,000 units in two days.</p>



<h2 id="three">Awards</h2>
<p>Weekly Shōnen Jump, in association with parent company Shueisha, holds annual competitions for new or up
 and coming manga artists to create one-shot stories. The best are put to a panel of judges (including 
 manga artists past and present) where the best are given a special award for the best of these new 
 series. The Tezuka Award, named for manga pioneer Osamu Tezuka, is given for all different styles of 
 stories. The Akatsuka Award, named for gag manga pioneer Fujio Akatsuka, is a similar competition for
 comedy and gag manga. Many Weekly Shōnen Jump manga artists have gotten their start either winning or
 being acknowledged by these competitions.</p>

<h2 id="four">Jump Next!</h2>
<p>Jump Next! (ジャンプNEXT!, Janpu NEXT!) was originally a seasonal offshoot of the Weekly Shōnen Jump 
magazine published on Japanese holidays. It became its own independent anthology that is published 
every other month on March 14, 2014.[26] The magazine was published under the name Akamaru Jump 
(赤マルジャンプ, Akamaru Janpu) prior to April 30, 2010.[27] Jump Next! features many amateur manga 
artists who get their one-shots published in the magazine. It also puts additional one-shot titles
 by professional manga artists, which promote upcoming series to be published in the main magazine. 
 Lately it's also featuring the last chapters of cancelled series from Weekly Shōnen Jump, such as 
 Enigma and Magico. It also features yonkoma of popular series such as Death Note and Naruto, as well
 as the pilot chapter of Bleach. Jump Next! has had several other past special versions:</p>

<p>Aomaru Jump (青マルジャンプ, Aomaru Janpu) was a single issue of Akamaru Jump.[28] One-shots that were 
featured in Aomaru Jump were Dead/Undead, Shōgai Oyaji Michi!, The Dream, Mieruhito, Yūtō ☆ Hōshi, and
 Fuku wa Jutsu.[29]</p>
<p>Jump the Revolution! (ジャンプ the REVOLUTION!) was a special edition of Akamaru Jump that was published
 in two issues in November 2005 and 2006. Jump the Revolution! contained one-shots of upcoming Weekly 
 Shōnen Jump series and soon to be Jump SQ series.</p>

<h2 id="five">V Jump</h2>
<p>V Jump (Vジャンプ, Bui Janpu) was originally an offshoot of the Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine in a special 
issue called Weekly Shōnen Jump Tokubetsu Henshū Zōkan V Jump (週刊少年ジャンプ特別編集増刊 V JUMP). The 
special issues lasted from 1992 through 1993. V Jump became its own independent anthology in 1993 for 
coverage of games, including video and card games.</p>

<h2 id="six">Super Jump</h2>
<p>Super Jump (スーパージャンプ, Sūpā Janpu) was also originally an offshoot of the Weekly Shōnen Jump 
magazine in a special issue called Weekly Shōnen Jump Tokubetsu Henshū Zōkan Super Jump 
(週刊少年ジャンプ特別編集増刊 スーパージャンプ). The magazine was published from 1968 to 1988, when it 
became a separate anthology for seinen manga.</p>

<h2 id="seven">Jump VS</h2>
<p>Jump VS was a special issue of Weekly Shōnen Jump, published on March 22, 2013. The issue focused on 
"battle manga" and included 12 one-shots.[30][31]</p>
