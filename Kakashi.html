<h1>Kakashi Hatake</h1>
<p>Kakashi Hatake (はたけカカシ, Hatake Kakashi) is a shinobi of Konohagakure's Hatake clan. 
Famed as Kakashi of the Sharingan (写輪眼のカカシ, Sharingan no Kakashi), he is one of Konoha's
 most talented ninja; regularly looked to for advice and leadership despite his personal dislike
 of responsibility. To his students on Team 7, Kakashi teaches the importance of teamwork, a 
 lesson he received, along with the Sharingan, from his childhood friend, Obito Uchiha. After the
 Fourth Shinobi World War, Kakashi becomes Konoha's Sixth Hokage (六代目火影, Rokudaime Hokage, 
 Literally meaning: Sixth Fire Shadow).</p>

<h1>Background</h1>
<p>Because his mother died when he was very young,[13] Kakashi was raised during his early years by his 
father, Sakumo. Sakumo was famed throughout the shinobi world, having saved Konoha on at least one 
occasion; Kakashi in particular revered his father. During one of Sakumo's missions - after Kakashi 
was enrolled in Konoha's Ninja Academy - Sakumo made the decision to save the lives of his teammates 
rather than complete the assignment. The mission's failure had disastrous consequences for the 
Land of Fire, causing many in Konoha, including the teammates he saved, to vilify him for abandoning 
his duties. Disgraced, Sakumo committed suicide. Seeing what his father went through and determined 
not to make the same mistakes, Kakashi decided that following the Shinobi Rules must always take priority.
</p>
 <h1>Personality</h1>
<p>Since his early childhood, Kakashi was very independent and self-confident, at times even appearing 
arrogant and condescending. Despite that, Kakashi was very perceptive and intuitive, quickly realising 
the situation for what it was. After his father's death, Kakashi became more stern, aloof and cold 
toward others, following all the rules to the letter, chastising any who disobeyed them and being 
willing to abandon his comrades to finish missions.</p>
 
 <h1>Appearance</h1>
<p>Kakashi has a strong resemblance to his father, so much so that they are sometimes mistaken for each 
other:[37] he has spiky silver hair often oriented to his left-side, dark grey eyes (black in several 
instances), and typically a relaxed and lazy expression. During the Third Shinobi World War, his left 
eye was damaged, leaving a vertical scar from the injury. The eye was shortly afterwards replaced with 
a Sharingan, which he covers with his forehead protector when he isn't using it. After his original eye 
was restored by Naruto during the Fourth Shinobi World War, Kakashi returned to wearing his forehead 
protector balanced above his forehead. Since early childhood and near-constantly, he wears a mask that 
prevents most of his face from being visible. Even his ninken have seen his face so sparingly that most 
of them don't remember what he looks like unmasked.[38] On the few occasions he exposes his full face, 
he has a narrow jaw-line and a beauty mark under the left corner of his mouth.[39] Overall, he is 
considered very handsome as seen from Teuchi and Ayame's reaction to seeing his face.</p>
 
 <h1>Abilities</h1>
<p>Kakashi is a natural prodigy, evidenced by his rapid rise through the ninja ranks.[43] His feats 
and renown cause him to be recognised on sight by foreign ninja like Zabuza Momochi and the Fourth 
Raikage.[44] Several members of Akatsuki considered him to be strong; he was deemed by Itachi Uchiha 
to be a dangerous opponent,[45] fought Kakuzu to a standstill despite the S-rank ninja's abilities, 
and was viewed by Pain as a major threat.[46] Kakashi is valued highly for his combat prowess and 
leadership skills, to the point that many foresaw his rise to Hokage status years before it happened.
[47][48] His prowess is so impressive that some believe he could take on an entire country.[49] 
However, the Sage of Six Paths believed Kakashi's greatest strength is as a teacher, leader, and 
friend, all of which proved vital in Kaguya Ōtsutsuki's defeat.[50] In general, Kakashi is a very 
versatile man with advanced proficiency in countless areas including mastery of all three main ninja 
skills; Naruto Uzumaki says Kakashi is smarter than Shikamaru Nara, has a better sense of smell than 
Kiba Inuzuka, is more adept with the Sharingan than Sasuke Uchiha, and has better taijutsu skill than 
Rock Lee.</p>
 
 <h1>Ninjutsu</h1>
<p>Kakashi primarily relies on his great skill and knowledge of ninjutsu, which he has displayed even as 
a child before entering the Academy.[56] Over the years, due in large part to his Sharingan, he gained 
a vast arsenal; reputed to have copied over a thousand jutsu and which led to his moniker as "Copy Ninja
 Kakashi" (コピー忍者のカカシ, Kopī Ninja no Kakashi).[57] With this arsenal, combined with years of 
 experience, Kakashi can handle almost any situation in various ways. He is also well-versed in 
 fūinjutsu, impressing Orochimaru.</p>
